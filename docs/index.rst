Welcome to oximachinerunner's documentation!
============================================

This package can be used to estimate the oxidation states of metals in a structure using a machine learning model. This model was developed to predict the oxidation states of metal cations in MOFs.
It also provides a basic ipython widget, that is used in `AiiDA lab <https://aiidalab.materialscloud.org/hub/login>`_.

Technical details and case studies are discussed in our preprint

Jablonka, Kevin Maik; Ongari, Daniele; Moosavi, Seyed Mohamad; Smit, Berend (2020): Using Collective Knowledge to Assign Oxidation States. ChemRxiv. Preprint. https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11604129.v1
